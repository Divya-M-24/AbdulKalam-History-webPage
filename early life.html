<p><b><center>APJ Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town of
Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, on October 15, 1931. His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, 
Jainulabdeen, was an imam of a local mosque and a boat owner. He was the youngest in the family with 
four elder brothers and a sister.
Though, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were raised in an atmosphere 
that was full of love and compassion. In order to add to the family’s income, Kalam had to sell newspapers 
during his early years.
He was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire to learn and was very hard working. 
He loved mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his education from ‘Schwartz Higher 
Secondary School,’ and then graduated from ‘Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli,’ in 1954. He wanted to
become a fighter pilot but his dream could not be fulfilled as here were only eight positions available in 
the IAF and he secured the ninth place.<br><br>
His father Jainaluddin was a humble boat owner, which he used to rented out to local fishermen.
 He was a devout Muslim and a close friend of the Rameshwaram temple priest. And this has made Kalam 
 to grow up in a multi-religious, tolerant society with a progressive outlook. His father often quoted 
 from Quoted to make the young Kalam see the world without fear. From childhood Kalam loved the sea and spent
 most of the time at beach watching the waves. He is strictly vegetarian. The spiritual simplicity of his 
 has turned to be today’s Kalam who believes in God, reads Koran and Gita daily as an ideal secular Indian.
 His mother kindled the tender feelings in him which infuses him to practice music and poems.<br><br>
Kalam had seven siblings, and his mother at times made chappatis for Kalam, while the others got rice as 
Kalam’s day would start at 4 am and end at 11 pm. As his father was not educated he wanted Kalam to study. 
Kalam would get up at 4 am and have bath and then go to mathematics class, the mathematics teacher used to 
teach only 5 students in the whole session and bathing before the class was the condition he laid to the 
students. After the class, Kalam along with his cousin Samsuddin went around disturbing newspapers.
