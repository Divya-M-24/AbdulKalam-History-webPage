After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the 
Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (
by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of 
the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a 
small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. 
Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space 
scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which 
successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first 
started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969,Kalam received 
the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space 
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, 
Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, 
both of which proved to be successful.
<br><br><br>
Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as 
the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, 
Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic 
missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.Despite the disapproval of the 
Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects 
through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role 
convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.
His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, 
which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.
 Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked 
 on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous 
 development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.
 R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88 billion for 
 the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as 
 the chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission 
 including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface 
 missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.
