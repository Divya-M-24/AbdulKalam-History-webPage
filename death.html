On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth"

minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition;
upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[85] Despite being placed in the intensive
care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST.His last words, to his 
aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"<br><br>
Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong 
to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules.
The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the Vice-President, 
the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the 
Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[90] His body was then placed on a gun carriage

numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President 
Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.<br><br>
On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base

He showed the way."Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, 
said, "our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self 
reliance in defence technologies. I worked very closely with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly 
benefited from his advice as president of our country. His life and work will be remembered for generations 
to come."[99] ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his former colleague "a great personality and a gentleman",
 while former chairman G. Madhavan Nair described Kalam as "a global leader" for whom "the downtrodden and poor 
 people were his priority. He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind to the young generation",
